<a id="financial-topics-discussed-on-social-media-and-cause-of-topics" class="anchor" href="#financial-topics-discussed-on-social-media-and-cause-of-topics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Financial Topics Discussed On Social Media and Cause of Topics</h3>

<p>Initially, the social media dataset was cleaned by removing punctuation, uppercase, </p>

<p>stopwords, non ascii values, extra space, and high frequency words with little meaning for this </p>

<p>research. These included: name, the, internet, are, excel, were, is, twit, twit_hndl, Name_Resp, </p>

<p>name_resp, twit_hndl$, w/, with, i, I, INTERNET, the, they, this, them. Please see the code flow </p>

<p>image to better understand our overall process to cleaning the data.</p>

<p>The most common words pulled from the overall dataset can be found in a document </p>

<p>titled “Frequent Terms.”  We created a dendrogram of frequent terms which can also be found </p>

<p>in the attached files. From these, we looked at correlation between frequent terms and other </p>

<p>relevant words in the data set. Some interesting correlations can be found in the document </p>

<p>titled “correlations.” The most commonly used words which most frequently concerned the </p>

<p>topics of banking services and words surrounding communications were words such as the </p>

<p>words “please”, “help”, and “call”. The dendrogram indicates the relationship of words to each </p>

<p>other using Euclidian distance formula. Words that are more frequently used together appear </p>

<p>in branches nearer to each other. </p>

<a id="are-the-topics-and-substance-consistent-across-the-industry-or-are-they-isolated-to-individual-banks" class="anchor" href="#are-the-topics-and-substance-consistent-across-the-industry-or-are-they-isolated-to-individual-banks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are the topics and substance consistent across the industry or are they isolated to individual banks?</h3>

<p>We used this corpus to create datasets that were associated with each bank. Each </p>

<p>dataset was then tested against an existing list of positive and negative words to find a </p>

<p>sentiment score of each word in the dataset. In order to quantify the disparity between the </p>

<p>mean sentiments of the banks as individuals compared to that of the entire data set, a T‐test </p>

<p>was performed. </p>

<p>The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the mean </p>

<p>sentiments of a given bank compared to that of mean sentiment of the banks combined. Please </p>

<p>see the attached document titled Statistical analysis to see each test. Looking at the violin plots, </p>

<p>the normality assumption of the t‐tests appears to be fulfilled as well as the assumption of </p>

<p>equal variance. Bank c and d have shortened tails, however, due to the size of the data set, it </p>

<p>can be determined that the t‐test qualifies as an appropriate model. The outliers are of no </p>

<p>concern due to the number of observations in the dataset and their effect is therefore </p>

<p>negligible. </p>

<p>Factors considered, it is safe to conclude a relationship exists between the bank being </p>

<p>discussed in a tweet and the positivity or negativity of the language in the tweet. In every case, </p>

<p>the p‐value was overwhelmingly small (2.2 x 10‐16). The null hypothesis can be rejected with </p>

<p>100% confidence. On average, the BankA posts scored higher on the sentiment analysis than </p>

<p>the general posts. The mean sentiment of each of the remaining 3 banks was lower than the </p>

<p>general average. BankD scored the worst, followed by BankC, and then BankB.</p>
