{"name":"Wells Fargo Analytics Challenge","tagline":"","body":"###Financial Topics Discussed On Social Media and Cause of Topics\r\n\r\nInitially, the social media dataset was cleaned by removing punctuation, uppercase, \r\n\r\nstopwords, non ascii values, extra space, and high frequency words with little meaning for this \r\n\r\nresearch. These included: name, the, internet, are, excel, were, is, twit, twit_hndl, Name_Resp, \r\n\r\nname_resp, twit_hndl$, w/, with, i, I, INTERNET, the, they, this, them. Please see the code flow \r\n\r\nimage to better understand our overall process to cleaning the data.\r\n\r\nThe most common words pulled from the overall dataset can be found in a document \r\n\r\ntitled “Frequent Terms.”  We created a dendrogram of frequent terms which can also be found \r\n\r\nin the attached files. From these, we looked at correlation between frequent terms and other \r\n\r\nrelevant words in the data set. Some interesting correlations can be found in the document \r\n\r\ntitled “correlations.” The most commonly used words which most frequently concerned the \r\n\r\ntopics of banking services and words surrounding communications were words such as the \r\n\r\nwords “please”, “help”, and “call”. The dendrogram indicates the relationship of words to each \r\n\r\nother using Euclidian distance formula. Words that are more frequently used together appear \r\n\r\nin branches nearer to each other. \r\n\r\n###Images\r\n![Dendrogram](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UX-U4OYanCS1SFR7AHoRgoY8uJqzvQL-olgRjpkit02SF1iVlAfrHL5QAxhqqrVM2OB3hg=w1314-h499)\r\n\r\n###Are the topics and substance consistent across the industry or are they isolated to individual banks?\r\n\r\nWe used this corpus to create datasets that were associated with each bank. Each \r\n\r\ndataset was then tested against an existing list of positive and negative words to find a \r\n\r\nsentiment score of each word in the dataset. In order to quantify the disparity between the \r\n\r\nmean sentiments of the banks as individuals compared to that of the entire data set, a T‐test \r\n\r\nwas performed. \r\n\r\nThe null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the mean \r\n\r\nsentiments of a given bank compared to that of mean sentiment of the banks combined. Please \r\n\r\nsee the attached document titled Statistical analysis to see each test. Looking at the violin plots, \r\n\r\nthe normality assumption of the t‐tests appears to be fulfilled as well as the assumption of \r\n\r\nequal variance. Bank c and d have shortened tails, however, due to the size of the data set, it \r\n\r\ncan be determined that the t‐test qualifies as an appropriate model. The outliers are of no \r\n\r\nconcern due to the number of observations in the dataset and their effect is therefore \r\n\r\nnegligible. \r\n\r\nFactors considered, it is safe to conclude a relationship exists between the bank being \r\n\r\ndiscussed in a tweet and the positivity or negativity of the language in the tweet. In every case, \r\n\r\nthe p‐value was overwhelmingly small (2.2 x 10‐16). The null hypothesis can be rejected with \r\n\r\n100% confidence. On average, the BankA posts scored higher on the sentiment analysis than \r\n\r\nthe general posts. The mean sentiment of each of the remaining 3 banks was lower than the \r\n\r\ngeneral average. BankD scored the worst, followed by BankC, and then BankB.\r\n\r\n###Additional Work\r\nAs we were researching, I found another dendrogram plot that looked cool and decided to test it. Changing the original code from\r\n``` R\r\nfit <- hclust(d=d, method=\"ward.D\")   \r\nplot(fit)\r\n->\r\n```\r\nto\r\n``` R\r\nhcd = as.dendrogram(fit)\r\nplot(hcd, type = \"triangle\")\r\n->\r\n```\r\nplots the branches of the dendrogram in a triangle shape. I really enjoyed working on this project and trying something new.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSamantha Quigley, Sonia Kopel, and Kendall Dunn also contributed to this project.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
